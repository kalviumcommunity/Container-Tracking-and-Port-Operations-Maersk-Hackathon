# Landing Page Implementation - No Home Before Authentication

## ✅ **Changes Made**

### **1. Navigation Structure Update**
- **Before**: Home component was accessible before sign-in
- **After**: Dedicated landing page for unauthenticated users

### **2. New Route Structure**
```javascript
// New routes:
'/' → LandingPage (public, no auth required)
'/home' → Home (requires authentication)
'/dashboard' → Dashboard (requires authentication)
// ... other authenticated routes
```

### **3. Created New LandingPage Component**
**Location**: `src/components/LandingPage.vue`

**Features**:
- ✅ Clean, professional landing design
- ✅ Feature showcase (Container Tracking, Berth Operations, Live Monitoring)
- ✅ Integrated Sign In / Create Account buttons
- ✅ Built-in authentication modals
- ✅ Responsive design for all devices
- ✅ PortTrack branding and messaging

### **4. Updated Navbar Logic**
- **Navigation Items**: Only shown when authenticated
- **Home Link**: Now points to `/home` (authenticated)
- **Landing Page**: No navbar shown (clean landing experience)
- **Breadcrumbs**: Updated to use new home path

### **5. Router Guard Enhancements**
```javascript
// New logic:
- Unauthenticated users → Redirected to landing page (/)
- Authenticated users on landing → Redirected to dashboard
- All main routes require authentication
```

### **6. App.vue Updates**
- Conditionally shows navbar (hidden on landing page)
- Clean landing page experience without navigation clutter

## **User Flow**

### **For Unauthenticated Users:**
1. Visit site → See landing page with login/signup options
2. No navigation menu visible
3. Can only sign in or create account
4. After auth → Redirected to dashboard

### **For Authenticated Users:**
1. Visit site → Automatically redirected to dashboard
2. Full navigation menu available
3. Home link goes to `/home` (authenticated home page)
4. Access to all main application features

## **Current Status**
- ✅ **Landing page fully functional**
- ✅ **Authentication flow working**
- ✅ **Navigation properly filtered**
- ✅ **Router guards implemented**
- ✅ **Responsive design optimized**
- ✅ **No home component before sign-in** ← **REQUIREMENT MET**

## **Testing**
1. Visit http://localhost:5174 (unauthenticated)
2. Should see landing page with no navbar
3. Click "Sign In" or "Create Account"
4. After authentication → Redirected to dashboard
5. Navigation menu now available with Home, Dashboard, etc.

The implementation successfully prevents access to the home component before authentication while providing a professional landing experience!
