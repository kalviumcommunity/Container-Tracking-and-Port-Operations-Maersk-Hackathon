# Event System Status & Implementation

## ✅ Delete Functionality - FIXED

### Problem
The delete button in the frontend was not working because the backend controller was missing the DELETE endpoint.

### Solution Implemented
Added the following DELETE endpoint to `EventsController.cs`:

```csharp
[HttpDelete("{id}")]
[RequirePermission("ManageContainers")]
public async Task<IActionResult> DeleteEvent(int id)
```

**Status**: ✅ **READY TO USE** - The delete functionality is now fully implemented and should work when you restart the backend.

## 📊 Event Creation System

### Current Implementation: **MANUAL ONLY**

Events are **NOT** automatically created when containers or berths are created/updated. They are only created:

1. **Manually via Frontend** - Users create events through the event streaming interface
2. **Via API POST** - Direct API calls to `/api/events` endpoint
3. **Via Kafka Messages** - When Kafka consumer processes messages (but this requires manual publishing)

### Event Flow
```
User Creates Event → EventsController.CreateEvent() 
                  → EventService.CreateAsync() 
                  → Save to Database 
                  → Publish to Kafka (best-effort)
```

## 🔄 To Add Automatic Event Creation

If you want events to be automatically created when containers/berths are created or updated, you need to:

### Option 1: Add Event Creation to Services (Recommended)

**In ContainerService.cs:**
```csharp
public async Task<ContainerDto> CreateAsync(ContainerCreateUpdateDto createDto)
{
    // ... existing container creation code ...
    
    // Automatically create event
    await _eventService.CreateAsync(new EventCreateDto
    {
        EventType = "ContainerCreated",
        Title = $"New Container: {container.ContainerNumber}",
        Description = $"Container {container.ContainerNumber} has been created",
        Severity = "Low",
        ContainerId = container.ContainerId,
        Source = "System"
    });
    
    return containerDto;
}
```

**In BerthAssignmentService.cs:**
```csharp
public async Task<BerthAssignmentDto> CreateAsync(BerthAssignmentCreateDto createDto)
{
    // ... existing assignment code ...
    
    // Automatically create event
    await _eventService.CreateAsync(new EventCreateDto
    {
        EventType = "BerthAssigned",
        Title = $"Berth Assignment: Ship {assignment.ShipId}",
        Description = $"Ship assigned to berth {assignment.BerthId}",
        Severity = "Medium",
        BerthId = assignment.BerthId,
        ShipId = assignment.ShipId,
        Source = "System"
    });
    
    return assignmentDto;
}
```

### Option 2: Use Database Triggers

Create SQL triggers that automatically insert events when certain tables are modified.

### Option 3: Use Domain Events Pattern

Implement a domain events system with event handlers that listen to entity lifecycle events.

## 🎯 Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Delete Functionality)
1. ✅ Backend DELETE endpoint added
2. 🔄 Restart backend: `dotnet run`
3. ✅ Frontend already has delete button - should work now

### Future Enhancement (Auto-Event Creation)
1. Decide which operations should create events:
   - Container Created/Updated/Deleted
   - Berth Assigned/Released
   - Ship Arrived/Departed
   - Critical Status Changes

2. Inject `IEventService` into relevant services:
   ```csharp
   private readonly IEventService _eventService;
   ```

3. Add event creation calls after successful operations

4. Consider event severity levels:
   - **Critical**: System failures, security issues
   - **High**: Operational issues requiring immediate attention
   - **Medium**: Important status changes
   - **Low**: Routine operations, informational

## 📝 Current Event Types

Events are currently created with these types:
- Manual event types (user-defined)
- Kafka-consumed events
- System-generated events (if you implement automatic creation)

### Event Data Model
```typescript
{
  eventId: number
  eventType: string
  title: string
  description: string
  severity: "Critical" | "High" | "Medium" | "Low"
  status: "New" | "Acknowledged" | "InProgress" | "Resolved"
  containerId?: string
  shipId?: number
  berthId?: number
  portId?: number
  requiresAction: boolean
  isResolved: boolean
  createdAt: DateTime
}
```

## 🚀 Testing Delete Functionality

After restarting backend:

1. Navigate to Event Streaming page
2. Click delete button on any event
3. Confirm deletion
4. Event should be removed from database and UI

**Permissions Required**: `ManageContainers` permission

## 💡 Next Steps

**Would you like me to:**
1. Implement automatic event creation for containers?
2. Implement automatic event creation for berth assignments?
3. Add event creation for ship operations?
4. Create a bulk delete feature for cleaning up old events?

Let me know which features you'd like to add!
